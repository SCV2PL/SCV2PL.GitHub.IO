# SARS-CoV-2 Poland - "EPIDEMIC" App

Good changes generate improvements, verify the knowledge acquired so far - when using it in practice.

In my free time I will improve, correct and speed up my "EPIDEMIC" app regarding the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Poland:

Improved file - import_csv_data_from_urls.py:

https://github.com/SCV2PL/SCV2PL.GitHub.IO/blob/main/V3/import_csv_data_from_urls.py

Deprecated unused file - import_csv_data_from_urls_deprecated_2023-01-12.py:

Formula Parse ERROR:

=QUERY(IMPORTDATA("https://api.dane.gov.pl/resources/33186,aktualne-dane-dla-powiatow/file",",",";"),"Select Col2,Col3,Col4,Col5,Col6,Col7,Col8,Col9,Col10,Col11,Col12,Col13,Col14,Col15,Col16,Col17,Col18,Col19,Col20,Col21")

=QUERY(IMPORTDATA("https://api.dane.gov.pl/resources/33186,aktualne-dane-dla-powiatow/file";",";";");"Select Col2,Col3,Col4,Col5,Col6,Col7,Col8,Col9,Col10,Col11,Col12,Col13,Col14,Col15,Col16,Col17,Col18,Col19,Col20,Col21")

Both Formulas work without error for this sheet:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JshfkqgC8bLhATHHkN3D5Bto19Sp3BpMBTYuAts5z_c/edit#gid=20230113

To my surprise and searching for the cause of the error - which I spent some time on, for this sheet:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_iDGD9XEd5Lw_AvmVo3XkAa4rBstaemnHeLKpyTgt8g/edit#gid=20230113

Only this formula worked:

=QUERY(IMPORTDATA("https://api.dane.gov.pl/resources/33185,aktualne-dane-dla-wojewodztw/file";",";";");"Select Col2,Col3,Col4,Col5,Col6,Col7,Col8,Col9,Col10,Col11,Col12,Col13,Col14,Col15,Col16,Col17,Col18,Col19,Col20")
